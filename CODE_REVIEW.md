# Code Review

## Inefficient use of code reuse in book-search component
## Implementation of Facade pattern
## Could show API load fail scenario in front end to improve user experience
## Could use date pipe instead of date formatting function
## Spec files didn't catch all working scenario.

# Accessibility
